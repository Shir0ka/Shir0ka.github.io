Notes:
The additive principle states that if event A can occur in m ways, and event B can occur in n disjoint ways, then the event "A or B" can occur in m + n ways.

Multiplicative Principle.
The multiplicative principle states that if event A can occur in m ways, and
each possibility for A allows for exactly n ways for event B, then the event "
A and B" can occur in m - n ways.

Counting With Sets

Do you believe in the additive and multiplicative principles? How would you
convince someone they are correct? This is surprisingly difficult. They seem so
simple, so obvious. But why do they work?

We will use sets to make things more transparent and mathematically rigorous. Do
not skip this section! It might seem like we are just trying to give proof of these
principles, but we are doing a lot more. If we understand the additive and
multiplicative principles rigorously, we will be better at applying them and
know when and when not to use them.

We will look at the additive and multiplicative principles slightly differently. Instead of thinking about event A and event B, we want to think of a set A
and a set B. The sets will contain all the different ways the event can happen. (It
will be helpful to be able to switch back and forth between these two models
when checking that we have counted correctly.) Here's what we mean:

Additive Principle (with sets).
Given two sets A and B, if An B = Ø  (that is if there is no element in
common to both A and B), then
|AUB| = |A| + |B|

Cartesian Product.
Given sets A and B, we can form the set
A x B = ((x,y) : x ∈ A  ^ y ∈ B]
to be the set of all ordered pairs (x, y) where a is an element of A and y is
an element of B. We call A x B the Cartesian product of A and B.


**Question 3**
Your Blu-ray collection consists of 9 comedies and 7 horror movies. Give an example of a question for which the answer is:

16 movies are the number of movies you have if you choose to watch one movie for the genre comedy and horror


63 is the number of combinations you can watch with two movies

Subsets should be familiar. Otherwise, read over Section 0.3 again. Suppose we look at the set                       A = {1,2,3,4,5}. How many subsets of A contain exactly 3 elements?


Bit Strings
“Bit” is short for “binary digit,” so a bit string is a string of binary digits. The binary digits are simply the numbers 0 and 1. All of the following are bit strings:

1001, 0, 1111, 101010101010

Bit Strings.
An n-bit string is a bit string of length n. That is, it is a string containing n  symbols, each of which is a bit, either 0 or 1.

The weight of a bit string is the number of 1s in it.

B^n is the set of all-bit strings.

B(^n _k) is the set of all-bit strings of weight.

This is an example of a recurrence relation. We represented one instance of our counting problem in terms of two simpler instances of the problem. If only we knew the cardinalities B(^4_2) of B(B4_3) and Repeated the same reasoning,

The integer lattice is the set of all points in the Cartesian plane for which both the x and y  coordinates are integers. If you like to draw graphs on graph paper, the lattice is the set of all the intersections of the grid lines.

A lattice path is one of the shortest possible paths connecting two points on the lattice, moving only horizontally and vertically. For example, here are three possible lattice paths from point  (0,0) to (3,2):

Binomial coefficients are the coefficients in the expanded version of a binomial, such as (x+y)^5. What happens when we multiply such a binomial out? We will expand (x=y)^n  for various values of n. Each of these is done by multiplying everything out (i.e., FOIL-ing) and then collecting like terms.

They are the number of subsets of a particular size, the number of bit strings of a particular weight, the number of lattice paths, and the coefficients of these binomial products. We will call them binomial coefficients.


**Problem 13**

Explain why the coefficient of x^5 y^3 is the same as the coefficient of  x^3 y^5 in the expansion of (x+y)^8.


The coefficient is the same because of the property of the combinatorial coefficient.

C(n,k)=C(n,n-k)

x^5y^3 has coefficient C(8,5)

x^3y^5 has coefficient C(8,3)

Permutations of elements. 
There are n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2).... 2 * 1 
There are permutations of n (distinct) elements.

In general, we can ask how many permutations exist of k objects choosing those objects from a larger collection of n objects. (In the example above,k=4, and n=6 .) We write this number P(n,k) and sometimes call it a k-permutation of n elements. From the example above, we see that to compute P(n,k), we must apply the multiplicative principle to k numbers, starting with n and counting backwards. For example

P(10,4) = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7.

Notice again that P(10,4) starts out looking like 10!, but we stop after 7. We can formally account for this “stopping” by dividing away the part of the factorial we do not want:

P(10,4)= (10  * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)/( 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 10!/6!

k-permutations of n elements.
P(n,k) is the number of k-permutations of n elements, the number of ways to arrange k objects chosen from n distinct objects.

 P(n,k) = (n!)/(n-k)! = n(n-1)(n-2)....(n-(k-1))

Note that when n=k, we have P(n,n)=(n!)/(n-n!)=n! since we defined 0! 



**Problem 13**

Consider functions f:{1,2,3,4} -> {1,2,3,4,5,6}. 

How many functions are there in total?
How many functions are injective?
How many of the injective functions are increasing? To be increasing means that if a<b, then f(a) < f(b), or in other words, the outputs get larger as the inputs get larger.

Answer

A: 6^4 = 1294. Because of the number of functions from A to B so, you have to A^B
B: Number of injections function from A to B, so you have to (m!)/(m-n)
C: Number of injective and increasing functions from A to B is (n!)/(n! (m-n))

Consider the following counting problem:

You have 7 cookies to give to 4 kids. How many ways can you do this?

Take a moment to think about how you might solve this problem. You may assume that it is acceptable to give a kid no cookies. Also, the cookies are all identical, and the order in which you give out the cookies does not matter.

Before solving the problem, here is a wrong answer: You might guess that the answer should be 4^7 because, for each of the 7 cookies, there are four choices of kids to which you can give the cookie. This is reasonable but wrong. To see why to consider a few possible outcomes: we could assign the first six cookies to kid A and the seventh cookie to kid B. Another outcome would assign the first cookie to kid B and the six remaining cookies to kid A. Both outcomes are included in the 4^7 answer. But for our counting problem, both products are the same – kid A gets six cookies, and kid B gets one cookie.

What do outcomes look like? How can we represent them? One approach would be to write an outcome as a string of four numbers like this:
3112
,
which represents the outcome in which the first kid gets 3 cookies, the second and third kids each gets 1 cookie, and the fourth kid gets 2 cookies. Represented this way, the order in which the numbers occur matters. 1312 is different because the first kid gets one cookie instead of 3. Each number in the string can be any integer between 0 and 7. But the answer is not 7^4. We need the sum of the numbers to be 7.

Another way we might represent outcomes is to write a string of seven letters:
ABAADCD

which represents that the first cookie goes to kid A, the second cookie goes to kid B, the third and fourth cookies go to kid A, and so on. In fact, this outcome is identical to the previous one—A gets 3 cookies, B and C get 1 each, and D gets 2. Each of the seven letters in the string can be any of the four possible letters (one for each kid), but the number of such strings is not 4^7 because, here, the order does not matter. In fact, another way to write the same outcome is

AAABCDD

This will be the preferred representation of the outcome. Since we can write the letters in any order, we might as well write them in alphabetical order for the purposes of counting. So we will write all the A's first, then all the B's, and so on.



**Problem 6 **

When playing Yahtzee, you roll five regular 6-sided dice. How many different outcomes are possible from a single roll? The order of the dice does not matter.

Answer 

We have 6 possibilities from each dice. So if there are 5 dices you can add the sum of them being (n1+n2+n3+n4+n5+n6) will be equal to 5.

nCr(10,5)=252
